# MUST READ

>:rocket: questions with there own directory are leetcode's questions other are found in codes directory.<br>
>:rocket: for all leet code questions I use LeetHub Browser Extensions to automate the syncing to my github repo

I have used typescript to implement the solution and optimize the code as much as possible.<br>
To Test out the codes your need to have Node.js installed in your machine.<br>if you don't have you can download and install from [Here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Then run this in terminal
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
